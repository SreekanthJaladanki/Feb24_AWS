2. The Wise Old Owl

There was an old owl named Oliver who lived in an ancient tree. He was known for his wisdom. Animals from all over the forest would come to him for advice. One day, a young rabbit was being chased by a fox. The rabbit ran to Oliver for help. Oliver told the rabbit to hide in a thorny bush nearby. The fox couldn't get to the rabbit without getting hurt by the thorns. The rabbit was saved, and it thanked Oliver for his wise advice.
