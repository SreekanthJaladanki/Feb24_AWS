#The Brave Little Squirrel

In a dense forest, there lived a little squirrel named Squeaky. Squeaky was known for his bravery. One day, a fire broke out in the forest. While all the other animals ran away, Squeaky decided to fight the fire. He filled his tiny cheeks with water from a nearby stream and sprayed it on the fire. He did this repeatedly until the fire was put out. Squeaky's bravery saved the forest and he became a hero among the animals.
