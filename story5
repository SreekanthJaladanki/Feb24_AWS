3. The Humble Butterfly

In a beautiful garden, a caterpillar named Charlie lived on a leaf. He was always envious of the birds that could fly. One day, Charlie went into a deep sleep and woke up with wings. He had turned into a beautiful butterfly. Now, he could fly like the birds. But Charlie remembered his days as a caterpillar and decided to stay humble. He used his ability to fly to help other small insects reach high places. Charlie's humility made him loved by all.
